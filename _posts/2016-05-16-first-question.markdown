#### You want to install new application on your smart phone


...

1. Permission to read phone calls (what else)
2. Permission to read your contacts (OK!)
3. Permission to Identify you (nice try)
4. Permission to your location (right brow raising)
5. Permission to read/write/DELETE your photos (Now you got my attention)
6. Permission to read/write?/delete your SMS, MMS, etc.
7. Permission to read your Browsing history (that is a red flag for everyone)
8. Permission to identify your Wi-Fi Devices... (that is way to much permission for any application)
