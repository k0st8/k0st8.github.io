# AdBlock stories

Two of visited today sites, where talking to me about adBlock.

Remove or Singin (Singin meaning you pay) and it's all good when you use this sites on daily bases, but  I was on this site first time... so asking to pay right away, is not so polite...

Imagine that you are reading it from your phone, you can see all the ads site is throwing on you, and here goes famous WOW it's my mobile internet you are using, it's limited and I pay for every 1Gb I use, over the permitted 20Gb... 

Is there any difference, mobile internet or home Wifi? I don't care if I see it on my Wifi, cause I don't lose speed after overdrafting bandwidth.
